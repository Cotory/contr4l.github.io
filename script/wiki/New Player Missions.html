Your home's got pretty much every little detail you need to know about yourself; what cash you got, what energy you have, and your name...in case you got drunk and forgot it. I do that all the time. Take a look, and then get back here by clicking "George's Missions". Oh and if you get confused while I'm helping ya'll learn how Torn works, just click whatever is flashing. Easy peasy.

Get your tush to the city gym and get a sweat going. They got all sorts of lifty majiggers and belly whatsits. Ya'll can level up and unlock more stuff eventually, just don't overdo it, cos your energy won't last forever. I threw up last time I went. Now I can't go back. Heh heh, they still ain't got the stain out of the carpet.

Even those fancy pants Corleone's started out hawking salad dressing, so you'd better try looking in the local newspaper, under the Job Listings page. You ain't much yet so you can't afford to be too picky. Heck I still shine shoes for $4 a pop. When you get a fancy pair give me a call. Jobs also build up your stats every day, and the higher your stats the better jobs come-a-callin' for you. So get out there and make yourself some dough.

             I ain't much for likin' them brainiac kids, but getting an education is a smart move. The more you learn the more you earn. Plus if you take a few classes you'll get other stuff too. Take a look. Gettin' educated can take days, weeks or even months and will use up energy. I get tired just thinkin' about it. But be patient: don't give up in the first week like me. I ain't done so good since I dropped out of kindergarten.

             I got lost on my first day in Torn, ended up sleeping behind a strip club. Wasn't so bad! Torn City can be pretty overwhelming when you get here, but you'll get used to it if you take a wander around. Visit some shops; look at the stock market--hey, go see what's in the town dump! I found a whole mattress down there. Barely a stain on it! Using the city map you can explore by zooming in. There is also a 'Quick Links' panel if you find that easier to use.

I put that energy to good use by swimming naked at the park and running away from the ranger, but you should do something more useful. Get to to the gym and spend the rest of your energy pumping iron. In the meantime I'm gonna take a nap in this here crate of defective beanie babies.

             Whenever you trash an item it'll end up at the dump. Old guns, soiled pants, those magazines you need to get rid of real quick. You'd be surprised how many people dive in here to search through the piles of hobo treasure, and you'll be even more surprised by what you can find, if you are patient. I found a box of back massagers yesterday. At least I think that's what they was.

Go and take a look at the current patients. You will probably end up in one of those beds at some point, so you might as well get used to the place.

Maybe have a shotgun wedding if you meet some smokin' hot widow down there. I make all my friends at funerals.

             One day soon you'll want to join a faction. Factions are groups of people working together and protecting each other. They commit organised crimes and go to war with other factions. None of them will have me because apparently I have an "interesting odour" and can't shoot for shit. But all of them are interested in recruiting people with high stats, which is another reason to spend a lot of time at the gym. Go and take a look at a faction or two! And ask them to let me in too.

           Once you have finished your new player missions, you will get a small goodbye message from George to encourage you to continue playing, and set you on your way to greatness!
          </i>

         <p>
          Great Work new player. I'm proud of you!
         </p>
         <p>
          It took you 26 weeks and 3 days to complete all my missions. That's a pretty good time for someone as green around the gills as you. I got high hopes for you new player. Don't make the same mistakes old George did.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now you know the basics - it's time to move on.
         </p>
         <p>
          You'll need to learn quick, think fast and stay alert. The competition around here can get pretty intense so make sure you train hard in the gym, get educated quickly, get promoted at work and always be on guard. Oh and don't leave your breakfast burrito out in the sun too long. Learnt that the hard way.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm sure a good looking guy like you will attract attention and it won't be long before you get a marriage proposal. I might even propose myself! But look, getting hitched is good and all, you get plenty of benefits, just don't lose focus new player. There's still plenty of missions, crimes and wars to be won.
         </p>
         <p>
          You're on your own now and life will start to get harder. Make sure you pace yourself... Torn is a long-term endeavour and gets more exciting the longer you're here.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you overdo it, you'll need to wait for your energy to regenerate naturally. To speed this up you could buy a donator pack for increased energy levels and quicker recovery time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Luck my friend. And if you ever see someone who looks like your pal George lying in the gutter, do me a favour and whizz in the other direction. See ya around new player.
